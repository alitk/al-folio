Hi, I am Alitak (Ali Taleb Zadeh Kasgari), an Applied Machine Learning Resarcher at Virginia Tech, and an AI enthusiast. My current research interests range from machine learning theory and implementation in general (Deep Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning,  Generative Models, ML Theory, Deep Learning, Causal Reasoning) to Convex and non-Convex Optimization. 



I'm currently working on how to adapt deep reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamic changes. An example of that is to adapt a four-legged robot such as [Spot](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot){:target="_blank"} that lost a leg in an accident.





I received my B.Sc degrees with highest honor in Electrical Engineering, Communication Systems and Control Systems (double major) from the [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_University_of_Science_and_Technology){:target="_blank"} and my M.Sc. in Communication Systems from Electrical and Computer Engineering departmet of [University of Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran){:target="_blank"}.
